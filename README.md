### Compile and run
Compiling (while in project folder)

`mkdir out && javac -d out/ src/*.java`

Runing

`java -cp out/ FluxboxManager` (while in project folder)
or

`java -cp path/to/projectFolder/out FluxboxManager` (from anywhere)

Also since I initially wrote it only for myself, the application window might be less readable on higher resolution screens.
